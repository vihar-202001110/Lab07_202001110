## Section A

First, I created 5 different JAVA files, namely, P1.jav, P2.java, P3.java, P4.java, and P5.java. Each file contains the corresponding function code to be tested.

> **P1.java** contains code to perform linear search on an array of integers to return the index of a particular integer. If it is not found, *-1* is returned.

> **P2.java** contains code to count occurrence of a particular value in an array of integers.

> **P3.java** contains code to perform binary search on a sorted array of integers to find a particular value. Returns *-1* if value is not found.

> **P4.java** contains code to check if given measurements are sides of a *SCALENE (2)*, *ISOSCELES (1)*, or an *EQUILATERAL (0)* triangle. Returns *INVALID (3)* if given sides cannot form any triangle.

> **P5.java** contains code to check if String *s1* is a prefix to String *s2* or not.
